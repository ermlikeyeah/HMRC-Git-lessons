# HMRC-Git-lessons
There are the assets for the "Get Git" lessons at HMRC Digital.

The lessions are unashamedly entry level, aimed at getting everyone to a similar basic level.

Some people taking part won't know anything about Git. Some people just want to know they are doing the "right thing".

The lessions are no more than an hour, and are deliberately not rammed.

The lessions are also about getting the particpants/students hands on.

Each lesson the particpants learn some things, try those things in the lesson â€“ and then are encouraged to go away and use that knowledge while they work.

Hopefully we will keep running these lessons as part of a continual improvement programme, to help instill knowledge and/or confidence.
